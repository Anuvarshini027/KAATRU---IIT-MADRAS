# KAATRU-IIT-MADRAS

### Goal:
Develop a model to find the variables that are significant in the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables and report appropriate metrics of your model evaluation.
### Outcome:
The variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes (at least 3).
There are 15 features excluding the target variable 'cnt' and to select the most relevant three features, Pearson Correlation is used and the regression model used is Linear Regression.

The variables  "atemp", "casual", "registeres" gave high correlation with the target variable when calculated.

R-squared metrics is used and the accuracy is 99.99%
